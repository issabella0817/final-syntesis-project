<h3>General Relativity</h3>

<h4>What is it?</h4>
<p>
  <br />
  General relativity is a theory of the gravitational field and general
  reference systems, published by Albert Einstein in 1915 and 1916. What was it
  about? The theory of general relativity proposes that the very geometry of
  space-time is affected by the presence of matter, resulting in a relativistic
  theory of the gravitational field. In fact, the theory of general relativity
  predicts that space-time will not be flat in the presence of matter and that
  the curvature of space-time will be perceived as a gravitational field.
  Einstein's basic insight was to postulate that at any certain point one cannot
  experimentally distinguish between a uniformly accelerated body and a uniform
  gravitational field. The general theory of relativity also made it possible to
  reformulate the field of cosmology.

<h4>space-time</h4>
<p>
  Space and time had their independent identities, and nobody ever got them
  mixed up. It was with the theory of relativity, put together in the early 20th
  century, that talking about space-time became almost unavoidable. In
  relativity, itâ€™s no longer true that space and time have separate, objective
  meanings. What really exists is space-time, and slicing it up into space and
  time is merely a useful human convention.

  The Newtonian conception of the universe considers that space and time are
  absolute, which means that they are the same for all those observed regardless
  of their relative motion. Einstein concludes that measurements of space and
  time in relativity depend especially on the relative motion of those observed.
  Moreover, it turned out that space and time are, in fact, intertwined

<h4>gravity</h4>
<p>
  At the beginning of the 20th century, Albert Einstein developed his general
  theory of relativity, in which he described gravity as a deformation of space
  caused by the presence of massive objects, similar to what happens when a
  heavy ball deforms a rubber strip. . This deformation "indicates" the smaller
  objects as they should move through space, so that they enter into orbit or
  fall on the larger astronomical object. This gave rise to a very different way
  of visualizing space. In the past, it was believed that space contained a
  fluid known as "ether", but when no one was able to prove the existence of
  this substance, humanity began to think that space was simply empty.
  Therefore, Einstein's idea that space was like a fabric structure stretched
  across the universe was revolutionary. He called it the "space-time continuum
