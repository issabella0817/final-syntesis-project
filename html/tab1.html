  What is it?
</h4>
<p>
  Galilean relativity states that the same laws of physics apply in any frame of
  reference that is moving in a straight line at constant speed. basically, the
  laws of motion are the same in all inertial frames of reference. Galileo
  Galilei first described this principle in 1632 in his Dialogue Concerning the
  Two Chief World Systems using the example of a ship travelling at constant
  velocity, without rocking, on a smooth sea; any observer below the deck would
  not be able to tell whether the ship was moving or stationary.
