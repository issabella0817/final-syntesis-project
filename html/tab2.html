<h3>Special Relativity</h3>
<p>
  It is a scientific theory of the relationship between space and time, it deals
  with the movement of bodies in the absence of gravitational forces. Is a
  theory for description of the events that happen in the nature, that is, any
  phenomenon that is can be described by observers.
  <br />
  Was published in 1905 by Albert Einstein<br />
  What he basically postulates is that light travels through empty space at
  300,000 kilometers per second and that nothing is capable of equaling that
  speed, much less exceeding it.
  <br />
  Where Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism were compatible with Newton's
  equations for motion.<br />
  Lorentz transformation <br />
  family of six parameters of linear transformations of a coordinate frame in
  space-time, relating the measurements of a physical quantity made by two
  different inertial observers
